# Community Support Tracker

## Project Description
PiXELL River Financial prides itself on being a good citizen. As part of our commitment to the communities in which we live and work, we are developing a Community Support Tracker. This tool will help us monitor and manage our various community support initiatives, ensuring we're making a meaningful impact.

The Community Support Tracker includes three main components:

1.Donation Tracker – Track charitable contributions, donation amounts, dates, and donor comments.
2.Volunteer Hours Tracker – Log volunteer hours completed by employees and provide an overview of total hours.
3.Event Signup – Register company participation in community events and organize roles for upcoming involvement.

Each component will be designed and built by our developers, using shared components and consistent styling across the project.
